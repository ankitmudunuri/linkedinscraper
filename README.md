# LinkedIn Job Scraper
I made a LinkedIn scraper as practice for working with APIs and documentation. I can proudly say I created this project just by testing it myself and utilizing APIs and documentation without the need to look up a guide online.

This project helped me get practice on using Selenium in Python, as well as the Google Sheets API.

Currently, I am trying to find a way to make it so that this can be publicly used by anyone instead of tailored just towards me. Thus, this project is not usable yet, but I am just putting the code out there as a display for now.
